VSDSquadron Internship

This repository consists of the various tasks and projects that have been assigned as a part of the VSDSquadron-Mini-Research-Internship-Program.

### Task - 1
### --------

Task 1 comprises of two sets labs:

####Lab - 1 
####--------

A C code named sum1ton.c was written and copiled using the gcc compiler and executed in the terminal.The program summed over all the numbers from 1 till the specified n value.
The correspoding code and the its output snippets have been uploaded above and can be found in the files starting with the name Lab 1.

####Lab - 2
####-------
The same code (sum1ton.c) is compiled using the riscv compiler and an output file by name sum1ton.o was generated. This file was disassembled to its assembly language code where the number of instruction used for the "main" section in the code or the main function was obseved and calculated.

A similar process was done after compiling the same code using riscv compiler but replacing "O1" with "Ofast".

The corresponding snippets of the commands and the instructions contained in the main section along with the calculation of the number of instructions have been uploaded above and can be found in the files starting with the name Lab 2.
